# Single-cell-analysis-in-coronary-and-carotid-arteries

We analyzed our own single-cell RNA sequencing dataset for coronary artery disease (GSE184073) and a publicly available dataset for carotid artery disease (GSE253903). Myeloid cells were extracted from these datasets, and comparative analyses were performed using metabolic profiling and RNA velocity analysis.

The code is written in R and uses the Seurat package.
